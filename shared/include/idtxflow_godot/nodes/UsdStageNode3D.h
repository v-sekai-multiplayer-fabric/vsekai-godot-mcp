/**
 * This node represents an USD Stage or an USD Layer defined by an *.usd[a|c|z] file.
 * All converted prims that belong to the usd layer will be assigned as children to this node. However, the attached
 * children are either hidden within the node tree and the whole node is representing an instance of a packed scene,
 * or the whole tree of children is visible.
 *
 * ## Async loading
 *
 * Stage opening (including HTTP fetching via the resolver) is performed on a background
 * thread using `idtxflow::async::StageLoadTask`. During loading, a placeholder cube is
 * displayed at this node's position. The following signals are emitted:
 *
 * - `stage_loading_started` — emitted when async stage loading begins
 * - `stage_loading_finished(success: bool)` — emitted when loading and conversion completes
