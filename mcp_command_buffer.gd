class_name MCPCommandBuffer
## Constant-work command buffer for the in-editor MCP server.
##
## Motivation (AWS Builders' Library, "Reliability and constant work"): the
## editor poll must NOT do work proportional to incoming MCP load, or a burst of
## requests spikes a frame and stalls the editor. So we decouple ingestion from
## execution: commands are RECORDED into a FIXED-CAPACITY ring (bounded memory +
## explicit backpressure when full), and each frame we SUBMIT a CONSTANT budget
## of them — the per-frame cost has a fixed upper bound no matter how many queue.
##
## Graphics-API command-buffer vocabulary: record() to enqueue, submit() to drain
## a budget. FIFO. record() returns false (and bumps `dropped`) when full so the
## caller can answer the client immediately rather than growing unboundedly.

## Submit up to `budget` recorded commands in FIFO order — the constant per-frame
## work bound. Returns the submitted items (0..budget).
